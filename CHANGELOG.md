## 0.1.0  
just first minor release; corresponds to 0.0.47


## 0.0.47
**bugfix**
everyNMonths and everyNMonthsAdd when the start (second param) is not passed were setting the defautl start at 0 which is not correct.

**describe removed**: need a smarter approach

**fullsetters fix**  
before that it was not possible for all compliant fields to be set (using setters) as multiple comma separated values, as  
`5,15-20,30-40/2,50/5`  for example for seconds.  

Now every compliant setter `x` has a `xAdd` version available which grants to add to the current value;
practically (assuming the default is not changed from `0 0 0 * * ? *`) this can be described with an example:  
``` js
qc.atSecond(2, 3)
 // 2/3 0 0 * * ? *
    .atSecondAdd(10)
// 2/3,10 0 0 * * ? *
    .betweenSecondsAdd(30, 40, 2)
// 2/3,10,30-40/2 0 0 * * ? *
    atSecond(3) // this resets
// 3 0 0 * * ? *
```
As a rule of thumb amyway only setters ending with _Add_ guarantee an addition on the target field.


## 0.0.45
added methods:
- `onFirstMonthWeekDay` (shortcut for `dom:1W`)
- experimental: describe works (only english locale shipped)

bugfix:
validators where not set correctly to accept multimple values like `2,30-39,45-50/2,55/5` for seconds for example
same was happening for all fields allowing multiple elements, giving false negatives when invoking `validate`
